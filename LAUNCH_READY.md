## 📊 Files You're Deploying

```
server.js          ← Your web server (runs on cloud)
package.json       ← Dependencies
public/            ← Website files (HTML/CSS/JS)
  ├── index.html
  ├── styles.css
  └── script.js
render.yaml        ← Deployment config
.env.example       ← Configuration template
```

**Everything else** (C++, CMake) is for local use - cloud only needs Node.js files!

---

## 🔄 How Auto-Updates Work

**Local workflow:**
```bash
# Make changes
# Test locally with: npm start
git add .
git commit -m "Updated X"
git push origin main
```

**Automatic:**
→ GitHub receives push  
→ Render/Railway sees update  
→ Auto-rebuilds (1-2 min)  
→ Your live site updates ✨

**Your friends see the update instantly!**

---

## 🌍 Deployment Comparison

| Platform | Setup | Free Tier | Auto-Deploy | Speed |
